# The project
Etch-a-Sketch! Here you can etch your colored or monochrome fantasies in a fantastic UI, made by me. 

You can do multiple things, like
- Change the brush size
- Draw random colors
- Draw with a brush (darkening effect)
- Erase the whole page

# The back-stage
With this project, I demonstrate my abilities of
- Using Git and commits
- Writing HTML in a semantical way
- Customizing CSS styles
- JavaScript abilities like
    - DOM Manipulation
    - Query selectors
    - Event listeners
    - Functions
    - and much more...
